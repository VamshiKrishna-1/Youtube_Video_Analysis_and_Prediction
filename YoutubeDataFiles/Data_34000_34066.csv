Financial mismanagement is rampant.', 'As a professional engineer working in the Jackson area, I commend you for seeing the importance of this issue and covering it much better than any news media reports ever have.  I think you reported most of the facts accurately and reported the story without trying to assign blame.  Here is a fact you missed however.  I believe the City of Jackson currently has only one professional engineer on staff.  They have been critically short of engineers for years.  Some exceptionally talented and dedicated engineers have served on the city staff during the nearly 30 years that I have been privileged to work with them, but they have almost all been lost to retirement, lack of pay, over work and lack of support.  The Jackson water crisis illustrates the fact that engineered system need qualified engineers to oversee their operation and maintenance, or they will fail.', 'As a controls engineer in the water industry, this is a great overview of the responsibility the industry has, and an embarrassing reminder of how bad things can get.

The physics behind washboarding would be particularly interesting.', ""Man, what a terrible situation. The residents of Jackson constantly losing access to clean water -- it must be terrifying for something so fundamental to be so uncertain. The fact that people working in the facilities were sounding the alarm for years and just being ignored is, to me, criminal negligence by the city government. There are so many stories like this, where saving a penny is more important than respect for what someone's in charge of. I keep thinking about the recent train derailment and vinyl chloride spill in Ohio, and wondering how anyone could consider their personal wealth more important than the consequences of carelessness."", ""I live in a completely different country. But we are currently losing 60% of all of our water into the ground every second of every day for 2 years. We don't get boil water notices (we can generate pressure without needing to pump it) but we do often get told to save water because the reservoirs can't hold enough. Its effectively the same problem here. Its really infuriating knowing that there is 30 years of poor and deferred maintenance that isn't going to be solved overnight and has made the entire system on borderline breaking point."", 'I worked for a civil engineering firm that had a long project on a small town\'s water system that was only billing 30% of their pumped water.  They hired us to write up a rate report to try and raise the rates to their customers to make up for the shortfalls their utility system was having.  Instead we recommended that we actually do a system audit, and if we couldn\'t find improvements then we\'d have the strong evidence that they needed the rate improvement.  The town council balked at our cost but agreed.  \n\nWithin 3 months we found and repaired 3 big ""hidden"" main breaks that brought their billable water up closer to 50%, and after testing all their meters we found that only about 10% were giving actual readings and most of the rest were under-reporting.  By the time we were done fixing all the broken mains and faulty equipment they were around 80% billable and didn\'t need to raise their rates.  I remember the head of the Town Council being VERY surprised that fixing things for real worked better than the band-aid patches that their water/sewer/dog catcher town manager kept doing.', 'One thing you failed to mention is the type of soil they have to deal with.

As an alternative to a large sewer expansion the city has started building green infiltration areas, such as roof top gardens, permeable pavement, and retention basins in public spaces.

I live in Fairbanks and we have quite a few special considerations to ensure all piping is below the frost line.\n\nAlso, have you done a video on the Alaskan pipeline? It's an incredible bit of infrastructure that boggles the mind in terms of complexity, size, and elegance of the chosen solutions. Basically, how do you keep an 800-mile tube structurally sound in an area known for earthquakes, powerful and destructive wildlife, and wild temperature variations from -70F to +70F?"", 'As a resident of Mississippi, I’d like to say how accurately you depicted this.

They may have to come out of retirement to teach us again.', ""Having been to Jackson quite a few, I can assure you the pipes were gonna break anyway, because breaks were already rampant. It's part of why the roads are irredeemably terrible. Pipe gets a leak and it takes months before it's really noticed and more months to get it worked on. Even then, often it's only a clamped on patch, which just means somewhere else in that old pipe is going to break within a few months.\n\nSome of the nearby cities, like Pearl, aren't much better with fewer broken lines, proportionately, but the same shoddy repair approach"", ""I'm from and currently live in Mississippi.

All of the adults know what happened to Lilo's parents, but the kids don't. Every adult in there goes from confusion to understanding in that instant, they connect how Lilo's behavior and mindset makes perfect rational sense once they have the context. So they aren't mad that Lilo attacked Mertle- they get it, that little girl just unintentionally insulted the death of Lilo's parents.\n\nSometimes with neurodivergence, listening to or otherwise understanding their reasoning for doing certain things makes perfect sense once you get the step by step. It usually makes sense to them, and if they are able to explain why they do things, it makes more sense to others"", 'I think a few things were missed:\n1. The reaction to ""Pudge controls the water"" is confusion only from the children, because it flies over their heads. The teens(the older Hula girls) and adults(drummers and teacher) react with horror because they know what happened to the Pelekais and understand how it can affect Lilo. \n2. Nani has always been written to be 100% neurotypical, it\'s her longstanding familiarity with Lilo that allows her to bridge the gap, it\'s why she also tells Bubbles that she needs her, bc she knows a foster family won\'t have the wisdom to address Lilo\'s emotional needs. She\'s an ordinary teenager(as long as you don\'t notice the clear implication that she was a pro surfer before becoming orphaned) dealing with being a sole guardian under probation with a limited support system(the closest she has is David, who\'s a teenager himself).\n3. While you did show Stitch\'s character arc, I think there\'s more to be said about how important re-socialization is for destructive children, how they can truly be rehabilitated. That\'s the conclusion the Grand Councilwoman came to when she changed the destination of exile to Kauai and assigned the two girls who clearly turned him into a civilized being as his guardians.', 'As an autistic child who lost both parents before the age of 10 and was adopted by a close family member who struggled dealing with me, Lilo & Stitch always hit so close to home for me.

Stitch is just as neurodivergent as Lilo he just exhibits different tendencies. Whereas in Lilo many see autism, in Stitch i saw myself represented through ADHD. He\'s impulsive and destructive and can be a little mean like with mertle and the dog who wants to sniff him, but you\'re even told in the movie that it\'s all he knows how to do, and he doesn\'t even have memories to comfort him in the still quiet moments. It feels like he destroys to distract himself, and also because people both in space and on earth don\'t respect his autonomy, treating him like and animal, freak, or monster for things he can\'t help. Lilo is the only one who truly sees him and acknowledges his personhood, his feelings. Because she sees herself in him. That\'s part of why it\'s so important for her that Stitch not be seen as some sort of irredeemable monster and she takes his ""model citizenship"" training seriously. if he can\'t be redeemed, what does that say about her? when the two of them are so similar?\n\nanother thing is how nani and david both accept Stitch rather easily.

Lilo is the best example on what it’s like being undiagnosed autistic as a child. Nobody around you understands why you’re the way you are or why you can’t “fit in” and “behave”. I got in trouble a lot as a child. I never understood why the other kids hated me or why the adults would yell. All I understood was that they didn’t want me to be who I was. I thought I had to hide it for people to love me. People could still tell I was different though. I didn’t have many friends, and the ones that I did have seemed to spend time with me out of pity. I’ve been working on unmasking nowadays, and while it’s hard, it’s been worth it. I haven’t been able to express myself in over 15 years, and now, at age 20, I am finally able to feel the way I need and want to feel. I can be loud, I can be quiet, I can be jumping around, or I can be sitting and quietly enjoying a video like this one. I haven’t really been able to unmask around other people yet, but I’m starting with my immediate family, and it’s getting easier day by day. I’m not ready to unmask in front of groups that I’m apart of because some of them don’t even know I’m autistic. It’s honestly easier for me to unmask in front of strangers. I’ll probably never see them again and if I do, I don’t know if I’ll even remember them. I’m broken, but I’m good, and I’m starting to heal. This video has been so nice to watch. I love what you do and I also watch Rebecca’s videos a lot so this was a good episode. Being able to hear perspectives about something that I’ve been dealing with for my entire life has been refreshing. Lilo and Stitch brings out my inner child and getting to see someone like Lilo who is exactly who I was when I was her age is important. Representation is important. I’m glad that more movies and tv shows are continuing that representation. It just keeps getting better and better the longer time goes on. Now we have shows like Heartbreak High that have autistic characters played by actually autistic people. Anyways, thank you for making this video and giving good insight on autism.

We\'re currently studying Dadaism (1916-1924), so I know a little bit about the subject. While it is true that the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building were made with the new materials of the time to try something new, they aren\'t the same kind of modernist art that you described. For many, modernism meant using new materials to build better ornaments. On the other hand, figures like Adolf Loos (who essentially foresaw the Rationalist movement of 1925) saw modernism as something purely functional. In his famous book ""Ornament and Crime"" (published in 1912), he stated architecture wasn\'t art because architecture had to follow functionality. That\'s why he designed his buildings with big white cubes and massive windows. The Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower were modernist because of their materials but there was absolutely no functional reason for their architectural style. You also mentioned other modernist buildings as beautiful, like the fallingwater, but quite frankly, they\'re still ugly. They still only have generic cubic shapes. It\'s just that one of them has a waterfall that goes through it. The need to mass produce and create new housing is somewhat of an acceptable reason. However, there are many architectural companies and art schools (like the Bauhaus) who want more minimalism and are pushing to destroy our cities. Quite frankly, I absolutely hate modernist architecture and I wish there were laws against these bland buildings. German cities are incredibly ugly nowadays because of modernist architecture. Kassel is a good example. It was a dense beautiful city. Nowadays, it\'s a car infested city that\'s way less dense and way more ugly. Don\'t get me wrong, I understand why they used cheap materials and such to rebuild it after WW2. However, they also made sure it was rebuilt with the car in mind.

It was a brick box with nice decor outside, some wooden slabs between floors, a nice stair (I especially love wrought iron ones!) and a roof. They had no plumbing, no electrical installation, no elevators, and even when they started to get all those things in the early 20th century, it was all very simple by modern standards.\nThese days, for example when a modern office building is being built, engineering systems like plumbing, fire suppression, electrical, comms, HVAC etc. can easily cost 30% or 40% of total cost to build a building.', ""Thank you for your video.

There are several other plants that look similar but are not members of the grass family. They may also be called grass. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.\r\n\r\nGrasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).\r\n\r\nEvolution of grass\r\nGraminoids include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves).[3] Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.[4]\r\n\r\nGrass and people\r\nLawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.\r\n\r\nPeople have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.\r\n\r\nSugar comes from sugar cane, which is also a plant in the grass family. People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 4,000 years. People use bamboo to build houses, fences, furniture and other things. Grass plants can also be used as fuel, to cover roofs, and to weave baskets.\r\n\r\nLanguage\r\nIn English, the word ""grass"" appears in several phrases. For example:\r\n\r\n""The grass is always greener on the other side"" means ""people are never happy with what they have and want something else.""\r\n""Don\'t let the grass grow under your feet"" means ""Do something"".\r\n""A snake in the grass"" is about a person that will not be honest and will trick others.\r\nAll flesh is grass: Old Testament book of Isaiah, chapter 40, verses 6–8.\r\nGrass is a slang term for cannabis (pot, weed, or marijuana).', 'Rage.

Sadly, I had to move to another  school a year later. 18 years passed, and we met each other this January. We have become both 25. He studies in medical school and I just came back to S.Korea after obtaining a diploma from another country. I didn\'t know he had been reading all my posts on my public diary for a few months when I was back in France. Though he knew the one who was writing the diary was me, he never said ""Hi"" to me. Then one day I deleted a link that had access to my public diary, so he missed a chance to let me know. \nA few years passed, and he noticed one comment in the comment section of one youtube video which showed a whole view of our hometown where we used to play together. That comment was, surprisingly, written by me. He noticed that it was me because I wrote down some of my personal background in the comment. He already knew I was living in France and I had a very special surname that stood out. \nSo we met each other once again through Youtube and we talked hours and hours on social media. We finally met each other this January and we had a nice Italian lunch, drank coffee and talked for hours and hours... I think we had a nice time. \nWe are not together tho.
